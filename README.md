# llm_code_extractor

Automatically extracts and organizes code blocks from LLM conversations, including support for markdown formatting and language filtering.

To run this code, create a file named api_key.py and set a variable named api_key equal to your issued serial key (e.g., api_key = "your-serial-key").
